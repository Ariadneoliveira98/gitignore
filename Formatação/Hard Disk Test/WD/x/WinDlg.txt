Western Digital Data LifeGuard Diagnostics - WinDlg (DLGDIAG for Windows)
v1.37

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
WinDlg (DLGDIAG for Windows) is a GUI application that allows you to quickly and 
efficiently verify the status of Western Digital drives.  It reports each drive's 
SMART Status and SMART Attribute values, allows you to run diagnostic tests (Quick 
Test and Extended Test), or erase operating systems and file systems on drives 
(Write Zeros).  If any drive errors are found, WinDlg provides an option to return 
the drive to a defect-free state through its Extended Test repair option.

WinDlg runs on Windows 7 and above (including Win8.x and Win10).  
Supported drive interfaces are: SATA, USB, FireWire, and SAS.


QUICK TEST:
The Quick Test can determine (in a short amount of time and with a high level of 
confidence) whether a drive is defect-free.  For maximum confidence, the Extended 
Test is recommended.  The Quick Test option may not be available on earlier ATA 
drives, SCSI drives, and external drives.

The Quick Test checks a drive's SMART Status and performs a SMART Quick Drive 
Self-Test if the drive supports the SMART feature.  If the drive does not support 
the SMART feature, a partial disk scan is performed instead of a SMART Quick Drive 
Self-Test.  In this case, the scan reads 10% from the drive's OD (Outer Diameter) 
zone and 10% from the ID (Inner Diameter) zone.  I/O operations are confined to 
the first and last 2 million sectors in the ID and OD to limit the amount of time 
that this operation requires on large capacity drives.


EXTENDED TEST:
Typically, the Extended Test runs anywhere from 30 minutes to many hours to test 
one drive.  Larger drives take longer to test; system performance also affects 
the test time.  If a bad sector is detected, this test may stop responding for a 
few minutes before it continues.  By default, the Extended Test is non-destructive.
This test is destructive only when you select the repair option after bad sectors 
are detected.

The Extended Test scans the entire disk media from LBA #0 to the maximum LBA.  If 
a bad sector is detected, you are prompted to repair it.  If you choose to repair 
the sector, WinDlg writes zeroes to the bad sector; this causes the drive firmware 
to relocate the bad sector and return the sector to a defect-free state.


ERASE:
Erasing data renders the data inaccessible.  This option can be used to erase 
operating systems and file systems.  QUICK ERASE erases the first and last 10% 
of a drive's sectors or the first and last 1 million sectors (whichever is smaller).  
FULL ERASE erases the entire drive and may take hours to complete (depending 
on drive capacity and system performance).
 

VIEW TEST RESULT:
This function displays recent test results.
 

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
 
BACK UP DATA:
Before you run WinDlg, it is highly recommended that you back up all data for all 
drives.  WinDlg may write to the drive during the Extended Test (refer to the 
Extended Test for details).  As with all utilities that write to a drive, it is 
recommended that you back up your data before proceeding.


TO TEST EACH DRIVE:
Double click on one of the physical drives in the list to display the test menu.  
You can also right-click on a physical drive and select Run Diagnostics to display 
the test menu.  Select a test and click the Start button to start the test.  When 
the test completes, a status is displayed.  For the Extended Test, if bad sectors 
are detected, a repair option allows you to fix any correctable errors.  However, 
when you choose this repair option, data stored in the bad sectors will be lost; 
thus, this function must be used with extreme caution.

WD provides a DOS version of DLGDIAG (called DOSDLG) which can be downloaded from 
WD's web site and used to repair certain errors that cannot be corrected in the 
Windows environment.


SMART STATUS:
Each drive's SMART Status is queried and displayed when you run WinDlg.  The SMART 
Status can be PASS, FAIL, or Not Available.  Right-click on a physical drive and 
select Show SMART Drive Info or double click a physical drive's SMART Status column 
to view that drive's SMART Attribute values.  Some drives (e.g., SAS - Serial 
Attached SCSI) do not return SMART data, so "Not Available" will be displayed in 
the SMART Status column (this is expected and is not an error).


INSTALLATION:

You can run WinDlg directly without installing it.  However, you can run WinDlg's 
Setup program (setup.exe) if you want to create a Programs menu item, a desktop 
icon, and a Quick Launch icon for WinDlg.  Running WinDlg's Setup program requires 
elevation (i.e., administrative privilege).  Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft 
changed Windows such that all processes run with the least user privileges possible, 
so you may need to follow the steps shown below.

Here is one way to run WinDlg’s Setup program with administrative privilege:
-Open Windows Explorer. 
-Navigate to the directory where WinDlg's Setup program (setup.exe) is located. 
-Right click setup.exe and select "Run as administrator".
-Follow the Setup program prompts.


REMOVAL:

If you attempt to uninstall WinDlg while WinDlg is running, WinDlg.exe (the WinDlg 
executable file) will not be deleted from its installation directory.  In this 
case, delete WinDlg.exe from its installation directory before you install a new 
version of WinDlg.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

On Windows Vista and later releases of Windows (like Win7, Win8 and Win8.1), the 
ERASE test may fail on drives that have partitions.  In this case, you will 
see an ERASE error message box with an error message that looks like this: 
  Sector #2048-2304::Erase error! Continue?
Run the ERASE test again and it should succeed.

On Windows Vista and later releases of Windows (like Win7, Win8 and Win8.1), 
repairing bad sectors may fail on drives that have partitions.  In this case, you 
will see an error message box with an error message that looks like this: 
  Unable to repair bad sectors.
This error occurs because Windows Vista (and later releases) prevents software 
tools from writing data to a drive that has a partition when the write operation 
is not performed through the file system.  This protects the integrity of file 
system data.  You may need to run WinDlg on an earlier version of Windows (like 
Windows XP) or you may need to run DOS utility DOSDLG (v5.22 or later) to repair 
bad sectors.
